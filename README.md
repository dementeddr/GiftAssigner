# GiftAssigner
A tool to assign categories of gifts within a group of gift-givers. Perfect for Christmas with the family.

## Known Issues
* Spouse-mirroring logic currently assumes entire group is made of spouse pairs with no singles.
* Inputs are currently hard-coded (planning to make input a plaintext or xml file).
* If given more categories than the number of people -1, it will assign people multiple categories (configurable option?)
